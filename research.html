            <h2 id="Title"><u>Solar Panel & Pollution </u></h2>
            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment. Pollutions are one of the major problems in America today and also in other parts of the world. Pollutions damages the environment, like water and plants, and also the
                health of humans. A way to stop pollution is going solar energy. Solar energy created by solar panels, can help stop air pollution around the world. Solar panels will reduce global warming, improve the health of human beings, and save
                consumers money.

                        <p>Pollution causes the temperature to rise which is global warming due to air pollution. Bob Hirshon, a scientist states that "In the summer of 2006, hundreds died as temperatures reached the 120's as far north as South Dakota."</p>

                            electricity annually. Choosing a clean source of electricity like solar panels can eliminate the same amount of carbon emissions that would result from burning 5,253 pounds of coal each year"</p>

                        on the bottom so when photons, sunlight rays, hit the panels silicon converts them to positive charge with the help of boron, a conductor, converts light energy to regular energy."</td>
