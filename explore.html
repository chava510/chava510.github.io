            <p> <b>2A)</b>The computing innovation I chose is credit card chips. The chips is called EMV which is an acronym for Europay, Mastercard ,and Visa. The EMV works by instead of swiping your card you dip it into the card machine. The purpose of
                credit cards chips is to reduce card fraud basically stolen identity. It function is a little different than swiping your card instead you now card dip. Then the process happens and your transaction is complete.
            </p>
            <p><b>2B)</b>I used a software called GIMP to create my artifact. First thing I did was created the width and height for my artifact. Then I separated the area into two parts. The tops is like what the card chips is and the bottom is just showing
                what it does and how card dipping looks. So I added then I added some images that i got from the internet and roasted them. Lastly I added some text to explain the artifact.
            </p>
            <p><b>2C)</b>Credit card chips are a new form of credit cards that will protect you from fraud while shopping.(1)The credit card chips are beneficial because it protects the shoppers, from the transactions they make and the information they input
                to be stolen.(2)It was November 23 when 40 million people's credit card and debit card information was stolen at target. The EMV, credit card chip, will now make it harder for the thief to gain data from your card. It will also lower the
                chances of your personal information to be embezzled and the big store will also not have to worry too much about information of their customers to be stolen. One harmful effect is that it can deceive people into thinking that all transaction
                will now be more secure, when in reality it does not protect you from online shopping. If you shop online like on Amazon or ebay which are not a store in the mall then the EMV can not protect, from your information being taken. This impacts
                the economy because credit card EMV are harder to steal or impossible, then people will buy more because now it is more safer to buy. People will now spend more on stores increasing the economy.
            </p>
            <p><b>2D)</b> The new chip in your credit card the "EMV" it is a little computer, on your card, to keep your information safe.(3) The credit card chip collects data about the transaction using the magnetic gold chip, on the front of the card,
                they work together to make a unique transaction number, using a process called card dipping. Card dipping is basically your at the cash register and instead of swiping the card like before you insert the card and does a the same transaction
                as if you were to swipe. Though this time during the process it creates a unique code for every purchase for no fraud can happen. If you are to duplicate the unique transaction number you will get an error because you can not have duplicate
                transaction. This is a data security concern because that chip on the card is a computer if you are to drop your card, then some can connect it to the computer and collect information about you and files that are private like addresses
                or social security number.
